# ClojureScript Reagent Starter

## Introduction

I wrote an article for Java Magazine and this repository is created for readers of the Article named: _Functioneel programmeren op de front-end met onveranderlijke data structuren. Het kan met Clojure Script_

You can clone this repository and code along with the examples mentioned in the article. If you want to go more into depth, I recommend this tutorial, where this boilerplate is originated from:
[Tutorial: Clojurescript App With Reagent For Beginners, Part 1](https://www.rockyourcode.com/tutorial-clojurescript-app-with-reagent-for-beginners-part-1/)

You can find more information about Reagent here: [Reagent: Minimalistic React for ClojureScript](https://reagent-project.github.io/)

## Before you start

Because you are working with a REPL, a specific setup is required for your code editor:

- For **VSCode** I recommend the following article that guides you through the setup [Clojure Development with Visual Studio Code](https://spin.atomicobject.com/2017/06/22/clojure-development-with-visual-studio-code/)

- For **IntelliJ** I recommend the following [Installing Cursive](https://cursive-ide.com/userguide/#:~:text=If%20you've%20been%20using,window%20and%20the%20Settings%20window.)

## Where to start

This is the file where you can start directly with coding:

```shell
src/breaking_bad_quotes/core.cljs
```

## Run

```shell
yarn install

yarn watch
```

## Clean

```shell
yarn clean
```

## Release

```shell
yarn release
```
